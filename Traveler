			<p>You have travelled the world, seeing its wonders and horrors with your own eyes. However you have travelled, you have lived in many lands, in the most diverse climates and under the most varied conditions. You have crossed paths with many people during your travels and are familiar with many cultures. As part of a merchant caravan, alone or in a small group, you've been to places that ordinary people don't even know exist. The big cities and their crowds don't frighten you any more than the deserted expanses, because you know how to get by in any environment.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Skill Proficiencies:</strong> Survival, Persuasion</li>
				<li><strong>Languages:</strong> two of your choice</li>
				<li><strong>Equipment:</strong> A walking staff, a souvenir from a faraway land (choose or draw from the trinket table), a book filled with notes on your travels or drawings, a bottle of ink and a quill, some travel clothes and a purse containing 10po.</li>

			<p>Your travels have taught you to quickly adopt the customs of the people you meet, their accents, the way they dress, the way they behave, even the way they walk. When you arrive in a town or region, it doesn't take long to pass yourself off as a local. What's more, if you wish, you can behave as if you were a native of every place you pass through. At the start of the game, work out with your MD how many origins you can imitate. You also know a few words of many languages, enough to get by in basic social interaction (saying hello, thank you, ordering a drink, for example) with almost any civilised humanoid (here again, the GM is the only judge).</p>
